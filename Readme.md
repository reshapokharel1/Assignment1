## This project is a basic HTML webpage designed by me(Resha Pokharel) as part of me learning html and css.
## In terms of structure, Iâ€™ve used some basic but important HTML tags like DOCTYPE html, html, head, and body to organize the content. I used h1 for headings, p for text, br for line breaks, and hr to separate sections. My image is added with img , and I used an iframe to embed the YouTube video. The footer includes a tags for clickable links,followed by span tags. Styling is done separately using an external CSS file (utils1.css) to keep things clean.
